# nodebeginner

This is my [ES6](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/es6/) version of the code presented in [The Node Beginner Book](http://www.nodebeginner.com). It works with Node v7.2.1 and Formidable 1.0.17. I make no other claims. I use [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [eslint](http://eslint.org/). I adhere to my own standard, which is not to use semicolons.
